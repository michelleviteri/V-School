    <h3>
        <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA’s Office of the Inspector
            General
            revealed that the CIA has
            mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
            highlighters. </p>
        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— “almost invariably the
            most
            crucial passages”—are marred
            by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting
            policy
            that began at the agency’s inception in 1947.</p>
        <p>“Why did it go on for this long, and this far?” said Goss in a press
            conference
            called shortly after the
            report’s release. “I’m as frustrated as anyone. You can’t read a single thing that’s been highlighted.
            Had I
            been there to advise [former CIA director] Allen Dulles, I would have suggested the traditional yellow
            color—or pink.”</p>
